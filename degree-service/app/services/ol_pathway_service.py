O/L to A/L Stream Pathway Recommendation Service

This service helps O/L students discover their optimal A/L stream and target degrees
based on their interests/career goals and current O/L subject marks.

Pipeline:
1. Semantic Career/Interest Matching → Find target degrees
2. A/L Stream Extraction → Identify required A/L stream
3. O/L Marks Analysis → Compare marks against stream requirements
4. Explainable AI Guidance → Generate personalized explanation
